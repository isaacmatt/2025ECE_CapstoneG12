# Pothole Detection on Raspberry Pi

Real-time pothole detection system built on Raspberry Pi using a custom-trained YOLO model, with GPS tagging for geolocated reporting.

Capstone project — University of Manitoba, Computer Engineering (Group 12), Sept 2024 – Apr 2025.

## Overview

Roads accumulate damage faster than municipalities can survey it. This project explores a low-cost, vehicle-mountable solution: a Raspberry Pi paired with a camera and GPS module that detects potholes in real time as the vehicle drives, tags each detection with coordinates, and produces a structured log that can be fed into a municipal work-order system.

The system was designed end-to-end — from data collection and model training through edge deployment, GPS integration, and verification testing.

- **Capture layer:** Raspberry Pi [model — e.g., Pi 4B, 4GB] with [camera module — e.g., Pi Camera v2 or USB webcam]
- **Detection layer:** YOLO[v5/v8/n] model trained on a custom pothole dataset
- **Localization layer:** Serial GPS module providing real-time coordinates
- **Output layer:** Detection events written with timestamp, GPS coordinates, and confidence score for downstream processing

## My Contributions

As **Computer Vision & Machine Learning Lead**, I owned:

- **Detection pipeline design** — selected YOLO as the detection architecture based on edge-inference constraints, designed the end-to-end image capture → inference → logging pipeline
- **Model training and tuning** — curated and augmented the dataset using Roboflow, trained custom YOLO models, iterated on hyperparameters and dataset balance to improve precision/recall on real road imagery
- **Edge optimization** — tuned inference parameters on the Pi to hit a usable real-time frame rate while keeping detection accuracy acceptable
- **Verification** — translated system requirements into testable features and wrote staged test procedures covering camera capture, model inference, GPS integration, and end-to-end logging
- **Technical documentation** — authored design and verification documentation supporting capstone design reviews

## Dataset

- **Source:** [self-collected / public datasets / mix of both]
- **Size:** ~[1400] labeled images
- **Classes:** pothole (single-class detection)
- **Augmentation:** [rotation, brightness, blur, etc. — what you applied via Roboflow or `AugPhotos.py`]
- **Split:** [e.g., 70/20/10 train/val/test]
- **Roboflow project:** https://app.roboflow.com/capstone-g12/projects

The augmentation pipeline (`AugPhotos.py`) was used to expand training coverage for varied lighting, shadow, and surface conditions — pothole imagery in real driving conditions varies a lot more than typical benchmark datasets.
